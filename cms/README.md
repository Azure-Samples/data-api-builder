# Headless CMS

Simple Headless CMS built using Next.js and Data API Builder

## Frontend

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

Navigate to `./frontend`

Install the required dependencies 

```bash
npm install
```

For an optimized build (production experience):
```
npm run build
npm run start
```

If not launched by default, open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

For future development and to see hot reloaded changes on the frontend:

```bash
npm run dev
```
